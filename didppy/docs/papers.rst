* Ryo Kuroiwa and J. Christopher Beck. `Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming: Generic State Space Search for Combinatorial Optimization <https://tidel.mie.utoronto.ca/pubs/Domain%20Independent%20Dynamic%20Programming%20Generic%20State%20Space%20Search%20for%20Combinatorial%20Optimization.pdf>`_. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). 2023.
    * This paper introduces the paradigm of DIDP, :class:`~didppy.CAASDy`, and DIDP models for :ref:`TSPTW <tutorial:TSPTW>`, the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), bin packing, the simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP-1), :doc:`MOSP <advanced-tutorials/mosp>`, and graph-clear.
* Ryo Kuroiwa and J. Christopher Beck. `Solving domain-independent dynamic programming problems with anytime heuristic search <https://tidel.mie.utoronto.ca/pubs/Solving%20Domain%20Independent%20Dynamic%20Programming%20Problems%20with%20Anytime%20Heuristic%20Search.pdf>`_. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). 2023.
    * This paper introduces anytime solvers for DIDP including :class:`~didppy.CABS` and DIDP models for the multi-commodity pick-and-delivery traveling salesperson problem (m-PDTSP), the :doc:`talent scheduling problem <advanced-tutorials/talent-scheduling>`, and the single machine scheduling to minimize total weighted tardiness (:math:`1||\sum w_iT_i`).
