DIDPPy
======

DIDPPy is a Python interface to use Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming (DIDP).
DIDP is a model-based framework for combinatorial optimization problems such as vehicle routing problems (VRPs) and scheduling problems.
With DIDP, we can use dynamic programming (DP) to solve combinatorial optimization problems without implementing DP algorithms.
Just like in mixed-integer programming (MIP), once we define a problem as a model, we can use a solver provided by the framework to solve the model.

Installation
------------
``didppy`` can be installed from PyPI using ``pip``.
Python 3.7 or higher is required.
