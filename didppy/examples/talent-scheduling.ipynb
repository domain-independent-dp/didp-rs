    "\n",
    "In a talent scheduling problem, we are given a set of scenes $S = \\{ 0, ..., n - 1 \\}$ and a set of actors $A = \\{ 0, ..., m - 1 \\}$.\n",
    "In a scene $s \\in S$, a set of actors $A_s \\subseteq A$ plays for $d_s$ days.\n",
    "An actor comes to the location when the first scene he or she plays starts and leaves when the last scene he or she plays ends.\n",
    "For each day actor $a$ is on location, we need to pay the cost $c_a$.\n",
    "We want to find a sequence of scenes to shoot such that the total cost is minimized.\n",

    "## DP Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a set of scenes $Q$ is remaining.\n",
    "A set of actors $\\bigcup_{s \\in N \\setminus Q} A_s$ already came to the location, and $\\bigcup_{s \\in Q} A_s$ is still on location because they need to play on the remaining scenes $Q$.\n",
    "Therefore, if we shoot a scene $s \\in Q$ next, the set of actors on location will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    L(s, Q) = A_s \\cup \\left( \\bigcup_{s' \\in N \\setminus Q} A_{s'} \\cap \\bigcup_{s' \\in Q } A_{s'}  \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to pay the cost $d_s \\sum_{a \\in L(s, Q)} c_a$ when shooting scene $s$.\n",
    "Once we shot scene $s$, the remaining problem is to decide the order of the remaining scenes $Q \\setminus \\{ s \\}$.\n",
    "Therefore, a state is defined by the set of remaining scenes $Q$, and the minimum cost to shoot $Q$ is represented by $V(Q)$.\n",
    "Because $A_s$, actors who play in scence $s$, are always on location when $s$ is shot, $\\sum_{s \\in Q} d_s \\sum_{a \\in A_s} c_a$ is a lower bound on $V(Q)$.\n",
    "We have the following DP formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\text{compute } & V(N) \\\\\n",
    "    & V(Q) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "        \\min\\limits_{s \\in Q} d_s \\sum\\limits_{a \\in L(s, Q)} c_a + V(Q \\setminus \\{ s \\}) & \\text{if } Q \\neq \\emptyset \\\\\n",
    "        0 & \\text{if } Q = \\emptyset\n",
    "    \\end{cases} \\\\\n",
    "    & V(Q) \\geq \\sum_{s \\in Q} d_s \\sum_{a \\in A_s} c_a.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A_s$, the set of actors that play in scence $s$, is equivalent to the set of actors currently on location, we can shoot $s$ with the minimum cost:\n",
    "we just need to pay for the actors who play in $s$.\n",
    "We should always shoot such a scene first.\n",
    "In state $Q$, the set of actors on location is $\\bigcup_{s \\in N \\setminus Q} A_{s} \\cap \\bigcup_{s \\in Q} A_{s}$.\n",
    "Therefore, we have the following equation in addition:\n",
