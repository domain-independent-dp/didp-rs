    "In a talent scheduling problem, we are given a set of scenes $S = \\{ 0, ..., n - 1 \\}$ and a set of actors $A = \\{ 0, ..., m - 1 \\}$.\n",
    "In a scene $s \\in S$, a set of actors $A_s \\subseteq A$ plays for $d_s$ days.\n",
    "An actor comes to the location when the first scene he or she plays starts and leaves when the last scene he or she plays ends.\n",
    "For each day actor $a$ is on location, we need to pay the cost $c_a$.\n",

    "Suppose that a set of scenes $Q$ is remaining.\n",
    "A set of actors $\\bigcup_{s \\in S \\setminus Q} A_s$ already came to the location, and $\\bigcup_{s \\in Q} A_s$ is still on location because they need to play on the remaining scenes $Q$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to pay the cost $d_s \\sum_{a \\in L(s, Q)} c_a$ when shooting scene $s$.\n",
    "Once we shot scene $s$, the remaining problem is to decide the order of the remaining scenes $Q \\setminus \\{ s \\}$.\n",
    "Therefore, a state is defined by the set of remaining scenes $Q$, and the minimum cost to shoot $Q$ is represented by $V(Q)$.\n",
    "Because $A_s$, actors who play in scence $s$, are always on location when $s$ is shot, $\\sum_{s \\in Q} d_s \\sum_{a \\in A_s} c_a$ is a lower bound on $V(Q)$.\n",
